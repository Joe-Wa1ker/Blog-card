## My process

- Outlined HTML and CSS on paper to start thinking about what was needed - HTML was the same in practise, aside from one additional div to contain the avatar and author name. CSS required more code than initially anticipated. 
- Built page and was most of the way there but had some scaling bugs, sought advice on Discord.
- Advice on Discord resolved all my errors, one of my HTML meta tags was missing some information. This is because I blindly accepted what VSC had suggested and when I encountered issues, I didn't suspect my HTML would be the issue. 
- Published solution.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Implemented some learning about min-VH from my last FM challenge, consolidated learning.
- Learned to make sure the basics were all there (HTML meta tag in this case), issues tend to be something simple you're not focussed on and haven't given due care and attention to. 

### Continued development

- Consolidate fundamentals - box-model, inline/block, continue developing more familiarty with dev tools, there are really helpful.
- More flexbox knowledge.
